# About Jimmie Coleman

## Professional Summary

Jimmie Coleman is a Cloud Security Engineer and DevSecOps specialist based in the United States. He is the creator and lead developer of GP-Copilot, an AI-powered security automation platform that combines policy-as-code, Kubernetes security, and autonomous agents.

## Current Focus

Jimmie is building GP-Copilot to automate security engineering tasks across the full spectrum - from basic vulnerability scanning to complex architecture decisions. His goal is to create an AI security copilot that can handle routine security tasks autonomously while escalating complex issues to human engineers.

## Technical Expertise

### Primary Skills
- **Cloud Platforms**: AWS (EC2, S3, IAM, Secrets Manager, SageMaker, Bedrock)
- **Infrastructure as Code**: Terraform, Kustomize, Helm, CloudFormation
- **Kubernetes**: K8s security, OPA Gatekeeper, Kyverno, Pod Security Standards
- **DevSecOps**: CI/CD security, SAST, SCA, secrets detection, container scanning
- **AI/ML**: Fine-tuning LLMs, RAG pipelines, embedding models, autonomous agents

### Security Tools Proficiency
- Gitleaks, Bandit, Semgrep, Trivy, Grype, Snyk
- Kubescape, Polaris, Kube-bench, Checkov, tfsec
- OPA/Rego policy development

## Career Philosophy

Jimmie believes in automating everything that can be automated. His experience transitioning from manual EC2 configuration to Terraform-based IaC taught him that engineers should focus on solving new problems rather than repeating solved ones.

> "Automate everything that can be automated. Your time is better spent solving new problems, not repeating solved ones."

This philosophy drives GP-Copilot's mission: automate security engineering tasks so humans can focus on architecture and strategy.

## Current Certifications & Learning

- **In Progress**: AWS AI Practitioner Certification
- **Focus Areas**: SageMaker, Bedrock, AI/ML fundamentals, security best practices

## The GP-Copilot Journey

Jimmie started GP-Copilot as a personal project to learn cloud security automation. It has evolved into a comprehensive platform featuring:
- JADE (AI security copilot)
- JSA agents (autonomous security workers)
- 14+ scanner NPCs for security assessment
- Policy-as-code enforcement with OPA/Gatekeeper/Kyverno
