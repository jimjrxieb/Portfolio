{"question": "What is PracticeMakesPerfect?", "answer": "PracticeMakesPerfect is Jimmie's immersive self-training environment that simulates working as a consultant at GuidePoint Security. Every day, Jimmie completes 10 realistic tickets covering cloud security, DevSecOps, and automation topics - exactly what a Junior Cloud Security Automation Engineer would handle at a federal consulting firm."}
{"question": "How does Jimmie train for cloud security roles?", "answer": "Jimmie uses PracticeMakesPerfect, a self-training system where he completes 10 daily tickets simulating work at GuidePoint Security. The training covers 5 golden topics (Kubernetes, Policy-as-Code, CI/CD Security, Scripting, Compliance Mapping) plus random domain exposure and interview prep questions. Each day has a 180-minute time budget with tickets ranked E through S for difficulty."}
{"question": "What are the 5 golden topics in Jimmie's training?", "answer": "The 5 golden topics are: 1) Kubernetes Security (hardening, RBAC, Network Policies, Pod Security), 2) Policy-as-Code (OPA/Rego, Gatekeeper, Kyverno, Conftest), 3) CI/CD Security (GitHub Actions, pipeline hardening, SAST/DAST), 4) Scripting/Automation (Python, Bash, YAML, JSON processing), and 5) Compliance Mapping (NIST, CIS, SOC2, FedRAMP, HIPAA)."}
{"question": "How many tickets does Jimmie complete daily in training?", "answer": "Jimmie completes 10 tickets daily: 5 golden topic tickets (one per core competency), 2 random domain tickets for broader exposure, and 3 interview preparation questions. The total time budget is 180 minutes (3 hours)."}
{"question": "What is the rank distribution in PracticeMakesPerfect?", "answer": "Tickets follow the Iron Legion rank system: E-rank (15%, 5-10 min, entry-level), D-rank (35%, 10-20 min, standard), C-rank (30%, 15-25 min, intermediate), B-rank (15%, 20-30 min, advanced), and S-rank (5%, 25-35 min, expert-level architectural decisions)."}
{"question": "What company does PracticeMakesPerfect simulate working for?", "answer": "PracticeMakesPerfect simulates working at GuidePoint Security, a federal consulting firm. Jimmie practices as if he were a Junior Cloud Security Automation Engineer handling real client tickets covering cloud security, DevSecOps, policy-as-code, automation, and compliance work."}
{"question": "What is the daily workflow in PracticeMakesPerfect?", "answer": "The 5-step daily workflow is: 1) Get Tasks - generate 10 tickets from config, 2) Jimmie Answers - complete each ticket within time budget, 3) JADE Answers - JADE provides reference answers for comparison, 4) Claude Validates - Claude Code scores and provides feedback, 5) Generate Training Data - create fine-tuning data from the session."}
{"question": "What types of interview questions does Jimmie practice?", "answer": "Jimmie practices 3 interview questions daily covering: Behavioral ('Tell me about a time you automated a security process'), Technical Deep-Dive ('Explain Kubernetes admission controllers'), Scenario-Based ('How would you respond to a compromised container?'), Architecture ('Design a multi-tenant security boundary'), and Tool Comparison ('Compare Gatekeeper vs Kyverno for policy enforcement')."}
{"question": "What Kubernetes scenarios does PracticeMakesPerfect cover?", "answer": "Kubernetes training scenarios include: Pod OOMKilled troubleshooting, RBAC misconfiguration analysis, NetworkPolicy design, PodSecurityStandards implementation, container escape detection, and Ingress security hardening."}
{"question": "How does PracticeMakesPerfect integrate with GP-Copilot?", "answer": "PracticeMakesPerfect feeds into the GP-Copilot ecosystem: JADE Supervisor learns from Jimmie's validated responses, JSA Agents get improved through training data, the Rank Classifier calibrates on real task difficulty assessments, and Defense Playbooks incorporate lessons learned."}
{"question": "What compliance frameworks does Jimmie train on?", "answer": "Jimmie trains on multiple compliance frameworks: NIST 800-53 control mapping, CIS benchmark remediation, SOC2 evidence collection, FedRAMP boundary documentation, and HIPAA PHI handling. This prepares him for federal consulting work where compliance mapping is critical."}
{"question": "Why does Jimmie use a consulting simulation for training?", "answer": "The consulting simulation approach works because: 1) Real consulting involves varied tickets, time pressure, and client communication, 2) Golden topics ensure depth while random domains provide breadth, 3) Daily interview practice builds confidence and articulation, 4) JADE comparison reveals knowledge gaps, and 5) Sessions become fine-tuning data for JADE improvement."}
