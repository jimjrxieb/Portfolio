# Test Knowledge Document

## DevSecOps Pipeline Enhancement
Jimmie recently implemented advanced security scanning in the CI/CD pipeline using SAST and DAST tools. This includes integration with SonarQube for code quality analysis and Snyk for dependency vulnerability scanning.

## Container Security
The containerized applications now include:
- Image scanning with Trivy
- Runtime security with Falco
- Pod security policies in Kubernetes
- Network policies for microsegmentation

## AI/ML Pipeline Updates
Recent improvements to the machine learning pipeline include:
- Model versioning with MLflow
- Automated model validation pipelines
- A/B testing framework for model deployment
- Performance monitoring with Prometheus and Grafana

This demonstrates the kind of knowledge documents that get processed through the RAG pipeline.
