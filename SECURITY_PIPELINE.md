# Security Pipeline Documentation

## Overview
This security pipeline was automatically generated by James-OS based on security scan findings.

## Security Gates Implemented

### 1. Automated Security Scanning
- **Triggers**: Push to main/develop, Pull Requests, Daily at 2 AM
- **Scan Coverage**: 81 security findings analyzed

### 2. Security Tools Integrated
- **Bandit**: Python security vulnerability scanner
- **Ruff**: Python code quality and security linting
- **Safety**: Python dependency vulnerability checker
- **npm audit**: Node.js dependency vulnerability scanner
- **Checkov**: Infrastructure as Code security scanner
- **Terraform Validate**: Infrastructure syntax validation

### 3. Security Enforcement Thresholds
- **Critical Vulnerabilities**: ❌ FAIL - Block deployment
- **High Vulnerabilities**: ⚠️ WARN - Allow with warning (threshold: 5)
- **Medium Vulnerabilities**: ⚠️ WARN - Allow with warning (threshold: 20)

### 4. Artifact Collection
All security scan results are automatically collected and stored as GitHub Actions artifacts for audit and review.

## Usage

### Running Security Scans Locally
```bash
# Python security
bandit -r . -f json

# Node.js security
npm audit --audit-level moderate

# Infrastructure security
checkov -d . --framework terraform
```

### Security Pipeline Status
Check the Actions tab in GitHub to see security pipeline results for each commit.

### Overriding Security Gates
Security gates should not be bypassed. If critical issues are detected:
1. Fix the vulnerabilities
2. Re-run the pipeline
3. Only deploy after security approval

## Maintenance
This pipeline is automatically maintained by James-OS. Updates will be applied based on new security findings and threat intelligence.
