# DevSecOps Security Pipeline

## Overview
This DevSecOps pipeline was automatically generated by James-OS GuidePoint to implement enterprise-grade security automation.

## Security Gates Implemented

### 🔒 Mandatory Security Gates
- **secrets_scan**: Automated Secrets Scan
- **sast_scan**: Automated Sast Scan
- **dependency_scan**: Automated Dependency Scan
- **container_scan**: Automated Container Scan
- **iac_scan**: Automated Iac Scan

### 🚨 Security Enforcement Thresholds
- **Critical Vulnerabilities**: ❌ FAIL - Block deployment immediately
- **High Vulnerabilities**: ⚠️ WARN - Allow with warning (threshold: 5)
- **Medium Vulnerabilities**: ⚠️ WARN - Allow with warning (threshold: 20)

## Pipeline Triggers
- **Push Events**: main, master, develop branches
- **Pull Requests**: All PRs to main/master
- **Scheduled**: Daily security scans at 2 AM UTC

## Security Tools Integration

### Static Analysis
- **Bandit**: Python security vulnerability detection
- **TruffleHog**: Secrets and credential scanning
- **Semgrep**: Multi-language SAST analysis

### Dependency Security
- **npm audit**: Node.js dependency vulnerability scanning
- **Safety**: Python dependency security analysis
- **Trivy**: Container and filesystem vulnerability scanning

### Infrastructure Security
- **Checkov**: Infrastructure as Code security scanning
- **Kubescape**: Kubernetes security posture assessment
- **TFSec**: Terraform security analysis

## Usage Instructions

### Local Security Testing
```bash
# Run complete security scan locally
docker run --rm -v $(pwd):/workspace aquasec/trivy fs /workspace

# Python security scan
bandit -r . -f json

# Secrets detection
trufflehog filesystem . --json
```

### Pipeline Monitoring
1. Check the Actions/Pipelines tab for security results
2. Review security artifacts for detailed findings
3. Address critical and high vulnerabilities before merging

### Security Gate Override
⚠️ **Security gates should NOT be bypassed**

If critical issues are detected:
1. Fix the vulnerabilities in your code
2. Re-run the pipeline to verify fixes
3. Only proceed after security approval

## Compliance and Auditing
- All security scan results are preserved as artifacts
- Audit trail maintained for compliance requirements
- Security metrics tracked for continuous improvement

## Maintenance
This pipeline is automatically maintained by James-OS GuidePoint. Updates will be applied based on:
- New security threats and vulnerabilities
- Updated security tool versions
- Enhanced compliance requirements
