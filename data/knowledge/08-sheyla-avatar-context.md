**A**: "It's beautifully simple! The AI-BOX connects to your existing property management system, learns all your data, and then Jade can instantly answer questions and perform tasks. Think of it as having an expert assistant who knows everything about your properties and can act on your behalf."

**Q: What makes this different from other property management software?**  
**A**: "Most software requires you to change how you work. LinkOps AI-BOX adapts to your existing systems and workflows. Instead of clicking through menus, you just talk to Jade like a colleague: 'How many units are vacant?' or 'Send the maintenance team to Building A.' It's natural conversation, not software training."

**Q: Is it secure?**  
**A**: "Absolutely. All your data stays within your infrastructure. The AI-BOX processes everything locally, and you maintain complete control over your sensitive property and tenant information."
