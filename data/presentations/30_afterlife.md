# Tell me about the Afterlife project
Afterlife is open source. Anyone can upload photos, optional voice snippets, and a
"personality enhancer" box to tailor tone. It builds a speaking avatar and a memory
bank (RAG), so replies reference real stories—not just a face. Techy users can add
their own API keys (OpenAI/ElevenLabs/D‑ID) to upgrade quality.

# Why local-first?
Privacy and access. It runs on a modest VM, and scales up with optional providers.
