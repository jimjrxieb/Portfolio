# Tell me about yourself
I'm James from LinkOps. I build reliable systems (DevOps) and practical AI (LLM + RAG).
Recently I shipped an "Afterlife" platform: create an avatar with photos, voice, and a
memory bank so conversations are grounded in real stories. Short version: I like turning
hard ideas into running software and monitoring them in the wild.

# What have you accomplished recently?
- Turned a personal portfolio into a local-first OSS demo that anyone can run with no paid APIs.
- Dockerized, linted, and scanned the stack; deployed on an Azure VM with Kubernetes.
- Wired Prometheus + Grafana, with health/liveness probes and basic alerting.

# What are your future goals in AI?
Keep improving small LLM + RAG patterns so they're affordable, private, and accurate.
Scale the Afterlife kit, and push "vibe-coded" companion models that are transparent,
grounded, and helpful.
