# IR — Incident Response

## IR-4: Incident Handling

**Requirement**: Implement incident handling capability (preparation, detection, analysis, containment, eradication, recovery).

**Implementation**:
- Falco DaemonSet detects runtime anomalies (shell in container, sensitive file access, privilege escalation)
- Automated response triggers for E/D-rank incidents based on Falco alerts
- Documented incident response runbooks in 03-DEPLOY-RUNTIME
- Alert routing to PagerDuty/Slack/email for B/S-rank incidents requiring human response
- Post-incident review generates lessons-learned artifacts

**Evidence**:
- `03-DEPLOY-RUNTIME/ENGAGEMENT-GUIDE.md` — Runtime deployment and response procedures
- Falco alert logs
- Incident response runbooks
- `{{EVIDENCE_DIR}}/incident-reports/` — Post-incident documentation

**Tooling**:
- **Runtime Monitoring**: Handles detection and initial response for E/D-rank incidents
- **Assessment Pipeline**: Escalates C-rank incidents for automated triage
- **Human**: Handles B/S-rank incidents requiring manual investigation and decision-making

## IR-5: Incident Monitoring

**Requirement**: Track and document information security incidents.

**Implementation**:
- Falco generates structured alert output (JSON) with timestamp, rule, priority, container context
- Alert correlation across time windows for pattern detection
- Incident tracker maintains all incidents with status (open/investigating/resolved)
- Prometheus metrics: incident count, MTTR, severity distribution
- Grafana dashboards for incident timeline visualization

**Evidence**:
- `{{EVIDENCE_DIR}}/incident-logs/` — Structured incident records
- Incident tracking database
- Grafana dashboard screenshots
- `05-JADE-SRE/dashboards/` — Dashboard definitions
