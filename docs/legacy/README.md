# Legacy Documentation

Historical records of major cleanup and refactoring efforts.

## Files

### API & UI Cleanup Records
- `API-CLEANUP.md` - Legacy duplicate removal from API structure
- `UI-CLEANUP.md` - UI component deduplication and optimization

### Technical Implementation Records

- `MENTOR-REVIEW.md` - Historical mentor review and feedback

## Purpose

These documents preserve the history of major architectural decisions and cleanup efforts. They provide context for:

1. **Why certain structures exist** - Understanding the evolution from messy to clean
2. **What was removed and why** - Justification for architectural decisions
3. **Lessons learned** - Avoiding similar issues in future development

## Archive Status

These documents are **read-only historical records**. They should not be updated, only referenced for context when making future architectural decisions.
